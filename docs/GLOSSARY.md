# Ladder Script Glossary

Alphabetical glossary of Ladder Script terminology. Every definition is derived from the
source code in `src/rung/`.

---

### ACCUMULATOR
Block type 0x0806 (Governance family). Merkle accumulator for set membership proofs.
Conditions carry a HASH256 Merkle root; witness provides proof nodes. Invertible (inverted
ACCUMULATOR = blocklist, "NOT in set"). Capped at 10 HASH256 fields (root + 8 proof + leaf).

### ADAPTOR_SIG
Block type 0x0003 (Signature family). Adaptor signature verification. Key-consuming with
2 pubkeys. Has no implicit conditions layout (no condition fields at all in conditions
context). Used for atomic swap and PTLC protocols.

(local and remote). Conditions: NUMERIC(commitment_number). Invertible.

### ANCHOR_ORACLE
Block type 0x0506 (Anchor family). Oracle anchor. Key-consuming with 1 pubkey (oracle key).
Conditions: NUMERIC(outcome_count). Invertible.

### ANCHOR_POOL
Block type 0x0503 (Anchor family). Pool anchor. Conditions: HASH256(vtxo_tree_root),
NUMERIC(participant_count). Invertible. Not key-consuming.

### ANCHOR_RESERVE

NUMERIC(threshold_n), NUMERIC(threshold_m), HASH256(guardian_hash). Invertible.

### ANCHOR_SEAL
Block type 0x0505 (Anchor family). Seal anchor. Conditions: HASH256(32), HASH256(32).
Invertible. Not key-consuming.

### ANYPREVOUT
Sighash flag `LADDER_SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT = 0x40`. When set, the sighash computation skips
the prevout commitment (outpoint hash) while still committing to amounts, sequences, and
conditions. Enables LN-Symmetry/eltoo-style protocols. Defined in `sighash.h`.

### ANYPREVOUTANYSCRIPT
Sighash flag `LADDER_SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUTANYSCRIPT = 0xC0`. When set, the sighash skips
both prevout and conditions commitments. Enables rebindable signatures across different
scripts. Defined in `sighash.h`.

### BatchVerifier
Struct in `evaluator.h`. Collects (sighash, pubkey, signature) tuples during evaluation.
After all inputs pass, `Verify()` checks them all in a single batch. On batch failure,
`FindFailure()` identifies the first invalid entry by individual verification.

### BlockDescriptor
Compile-time descriptor struct in `types.h`. Contains block type metadata: type code, name,
known/invertible/key-consuming flags, pubkey count, pointers to conditions and witness
implicit layouts, and a `conditions_only` flag. The `LookupBlockDescriptor()` function
provides a runtime lookup table of all 61 block types.

### CLTV
Block type 0x0103 (Timelock family). Absolute timelock checking nLockTime against a
block-height threshold. Invertible. Conditions: NUMERIC(height).

### CLTV_SIG

### CLTV_TIME
Block type 0x0104 (Timelock family). Absolute timelock checking nLockTime against a
median-time-past threshold. Invertible. Conditions: NUMERIC(time).

### COIL_MAP
See RungCoil. The coil metadata attached to each output/witness, defining unlock semantics
(coil_type), attestation mode, signature scheme, address hash, and per-rung destination
overrides (rung_destinations).

### COMPARE
Block type 0x0641 (PLC family). Comparator for amount vs thresholds. Conditions:
NUMERIC(operator), NUMERIC(value_b), NUMERIC(value_c). Invertible.

### Conditions
See RungConditions. The locking side of a v4 output. In TX_MLSC format, conditions are
stored as a shared conditions_root per transaction (0xDF prefix); each output is 8 bytes
(value only). Contains rungs (with blocks), a coil, and optionally relays. Only condition
data types are allowed: HASH256, HASH160, NUMERIC, SCHEME, SPEND_INDEX, DATA. Never
PUBKEY, SIGNATURE, PREIMAGE, or SCRIPT_BODY.

### Creation Proof
A witness section validated at block acceptance in the TX_MLSC format. The creation proof
binds the shared conditions_root to the transaction's outputs, proving that the structural
template and value commitments are correctly constructed.

### COSIGN
Block type 0x0681 (PLC family). Cross-input co-spend constraint. Requires another input
in the same transaction to have matching conditions identified by a HASH256. Key-consuming
(despite being in the PLC range). Not invertible. Uses the `spent_outputs` field of
RungEvalContext.

a block-height threshold. Invertible. Conditions: NUMERIC(blocks).

### CSV_TIME

a time-based threshold. Invertible. Conditions: NUMERIC(seconds).

### CTV
Block type 0x0301 (Covenant family). OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY covenant. Conditions:
HASH256(template_hash). Invertible. The template hash is computed by `ComputeCTVHash()`
in `evaluator.h`, following BIP-119.

### DATA
Data type 0x0B. Opaque data, 1 to 40 bytes. Restricted to DATA_RETURN blocks only.
Rejected in all other block types at deserialization.

### DATA_RETURN
Block type 0x0507 (Anchor family). Unspendable data commitment, replacing OP_RETURN.
Maximum 40 bytes of DATA. Exactly one DATA_RETURN per transaction. Conditions:
DATA(var). Invertible.

### Descriptor
A human-readable text format for Ladder Script conditions. Grammar:
`ladder(or(rung1, rung2, ...))` where each rung is a block or `and(block, block, ...)`.
Blocks use lowercase names: `sig(@alias)`, `csv(N)`, `multisig(M, @pk1, ...)`, etc.
Parsed by `ParseDescriptor()`, formatted by `FormatDescriptor()` in `descriptor.h/cpp`.

### EPOCH_GATE
Block type 0x0801 (Governance family). Periodic spending window: spendable only when
`block_height mod period == offset`. Not invertible. Conditions: NUMERIC(period),
NUMERIC(offset).

### EvalResult
Enum in `evaluator.h`. Four values: SATISFIED (conditions met), UNSATISFIED (valid but
fails), ERROR (malformed block, consensus failure), UNKNOWN_BLOCK_TYPE (forward-compat,
treated as unsatisfied). `ApplyInversion()` flips SATISFIED/UNSATISFIED; ERROR is unchanged;
UNKNOWN_BLOCK_TYPE inverted becomes SATISFIED.

### HASH_GUARDED
Block type 0x0204 (Hash family). Raw SHA256 preimage verification. Conditions:
HASH256(hash). Witness: PREIMAGE(preimage). Not invertible, not key-consuming.

### HASH_SIG
Block type 0x0703 (Compound family). Hash preimage + signature combined. Key-consuming
with 1 pubkey. Conditions: HASH256(hash), SCHEME(1). Witness: PUBKEY, SIGNATURE, PREIMAGE.

### HASH160

### HASH256
Data type 0x03. SHA-256 hash, exactly 32 bytes.

### HTLC

Witness: PUBKEY, SIGNATURE, PUBKEY, PREIMAGE, NUMERIC.

### HYSTERESIS_FEE
Block type 0x0601 (PLC family). Fee hysteresis band. Conditions: NUMERIC(high_sat_vb),
NUMERIC(low_sat_vb). Invertible.

### HYSTERESIS_VALUE
Block type 0x0602 (PLC family). Value hysteresis band. Conditions: NUMERIC(high_sats),
NUMERIC(low_sats). Invertible.

### Implicit Layout
A per-block-type, per-context fixed field table defined in `types.h`. When a block uses
a micro-header and its fields match the implicit layout, the field count and type bytes
are omitted from the wire format. The deserializer uses the micro-header + layout presence
as the signal for implicit encoding. Defined by `ImplicitFieldLayout` struct and queried
via `GetImplicitLayout()`.

### Inline Conditions
The 0xC1 prefix format for embedding conditions directly in scriptPubKey. **Removed.**
`IsRungConditionsScript()` always returns false. All outputs must use TX_MLSC (0xDF).

### INPUT_COUNT
Block type 0x0803 (Governance family). Input count bounds on the spending transaction.
Conditions: NUMERIC(min_inputs), NUMERIC(max_inputs). Invertible.

### Inversion
The ability to flip a block's evaluation result. When a block's `inverted` flag is true,
SATISFIED becomes UNSATISFIED and vice versa. Only blocks on the `IsInvertibleBlockType()`
allowlist may be inverted. Key-consuming blocks are never invertible. Encoded on the wire
as header byte 0x81 (escape + inverted). See `ApplyInversion()` in `evaluator.h`.

### KEY_REF_SIG
Block type 0x0005 (Signature family). Signature verification using a key commitment
resolved from a relay block. Key-consuming. Conditions: NUMERIC(relay_index),
NUMERIC(block_index). The actual pubkey is looked up from the referenced relay's
PUBKEY_COMMIT field at evaluation time.

### Ladder
The complete set of spending paths for one output. Represented by `LadderWitness` in
`types.h`. Contains rungs (OR paths), a coil (output metadata), relays (shared conditions),
and optionally a witness reference (diff witness). `EvalLadder()` evaluates relays first,
then tries each rung in order; the first satisfied rung wins.

### LadderSignatureChecker
Class in `evaluator.h`. Wraps an existing `BaseSignatureChecker` and adds rung conditions
context. When `CheckSchnorrSignature()` is called with `SigVersion::LADDER`, it computes
`SignatureHashLadder` instead of `SignatureHashSchnorr`. Supports batch verification via
an optional `m_batch` pointer to `BatchVerifier`.

### LATCH_RESET
Block type 0x0622 (PLC family). Latch reset (state deactivation). Key-consuming with
1 pubkey (resetter key). Conditions: NUMERIC(state), NUMERIC(delay). Invertible.

### LATCH_SET
Block type 0x0621 (PLC family). Latch set (state activation). Key-consuming with 1
pubkey (setter key). Conditions: NUMERIC(state). Invertible.

### Merkle
See MLSC. Ladder Script uses binary Merkle trees with sorted interior hashing:
`SHA256(0x01 || min(left, right) || max(left, right))`. Leaves are padded to the next
power of 2 using `MLSC_EMPTY_LEAF = SHA256("LADDER_EMPTY_LEAF")`. Functions:
`BuildMerkleTree()`, `ComputeRungLeaf()`, `ComputeCoilLeaf()`, `ComputeRelayLeaf()`,
`ComputeConditionsRoot()`. All in `conditions.h/cpp`.

### merkle_pub_key
The mechanism by which public keys are folded into MLSC Merkle leaf hashes rather than
stored as condition fields. `PubkeyCountForBlock()` in `types.h` determines how many
pubkeys each key-consuming block contributes. `ComputeRungLeaf()` appends pubkeys to the
serialized rung data before hashing. This prevents arbitrary data embedding through the
PUBKEY_COMMIT writable surface.

### Micro-header
A 1-byte encoding for common block types, replacing the 2-byte type code + inversion flag.
Values 0x00 through 0x7F index into `MICRO_HEADER_TABLE[]` (128 slots, 63 active, 2
deprecated slots 0x07/0x08 set to 0xFFFF). Escape bytes: 0x80 = full header (not inverted),
0x81 = full header (inverted). Defined in `types.h`.

### MLSC
Merkelized Ladder Script Conditions. The per-output format prior to TX_MLSC. Originally
`0xDF + 32-byte conditions_root` (33 bytes per output). Superseded by TX_MLSC which
uses a shared conditions_root per transaction with 0xDF prefix and 8 bytes per output.
See TX_MLSC.

### output_index
A field on each rung's coil in the TX_MLSC format declaring which transaction output
that rung governs. Enables the shared-tree model where one Merkle tree covers multiple
outputs.

### MLSCProof
Struct in `conditions.h`. Carried in witness `stack[1]` when spending an MLSC output.
Contains: total_rungs, total_relays, rung_index, revealed_rung, revealed_relays,
proof_hashes (leaf hashes for unrevealed leaves), and optional revealed_mutation_targets
for cross-rung mutation access.

### MLSCVerifiedLeaves
Struct in `conditions.h`. Output of `VerifyMLSCProof()`. Contains the full leaf array,
verified root, rung index, and counts. Used by covenant evaluators to mutate a leaf,
rebuild the Merkle tree, and compare against the output root.

### MULTISIG
Block type 0x0002 (Signature family). M-of-N threshold signature. Key-consuming with
variable pubkey count (counted from PUBKEY fields). Conditions: NUMERIC(threshold_M).
Not invertible.

### MUSIG_THRESHOLD

Key-consuming with 1 pubkey. Conditions: NUMERIC(M), NUMERIC(N). Not invertible.

### NUMERIC
Data type 0x08. Numeric value (threshold, locktime, etc.), 1 to 4 bytes little-endian.
Encoded as CompactSize (varint) in the wire format when using implicit layouts. Always
stored internally as 4-byte LE.

### ONE_SHOT
Block type 0x0661 (PLC family). One-shot activation window. Conditions: NUMERIC(state),
HASH256(commitment). Invertible. Not key-consuming.

NUMERIC(output_index), NUMERIC(min_sats), NUMERIC(max_sats), HASH256(script_hash). Not
invertible. Verifies that a specific output has a value within bounds and a script matching
the committed hash.

Block type 0x0902 (Legacy family). Wrapped P2PKH. Key-consuming (pubkey in witness, hash
in conditions). Conditions: HASH160(20). Not invertible. Pubkey count 0 in PubkeyCountForBlock
because pubkey is hashed, not folded into Merkle leaf.

### P2SH_LEGACY

### PLC
Programmable Logic Controller. A family of 14 block types (0x0600-0x06FF) inspired by

TIMER_OFF_DELAY, LATCH_SET, LATCH_RESET, COUNTER_DOWN, COUNTER_PRESET, COUNTER_UP,
COMPARE, SEQUENCER, ONE_SHOT, RATE_LIMIT, and COSIGN. These enable stateful spending
logic via recursive covenants.

AGGREGATE and DEFERRED are reserved for future extension (rejected at deserialization).

### RungBlock
Struct in `types.h`. A function block within a rung. Contains a `RungBlockType`, a vector
of `RungField` typed fields, and an `inverted` flag.

UNLOCK_TO, COVENANT), `attestation` (INLINE only; AGGREGATE/DEFERRED reserved), `scheme` (SCHNORR,
ECDSA, FALCON512, FALCON1024, DILITHIUM3, SPHINCS_SHA), `address_hash` (SHA256 of raw
address, 0 or 32 bytes), `conditions` (reserved, must be empty), `rung_destinations`
(per-rung destination overrides as pairs of rung_index + address_hash).

### RungConditions

optional template_ref, optional conditions_root (MLSC root from UTXO). Key methods:
`IsMLSC()`, `IsTemplateRef()`, `IsEmpty()`.

(`IsPQScheme()` returns true).

### RUNG_TX_VERSION
Transaction version 4. All Ladder Script transactions use this version. Defined as a
consensus constant. Outputs use TX_MLSC format (0xDF prefix, 8 bytes per output, shared
conditions_root per transaction). Flag byte 0x02 signals TX_MLSC serialization. Witnesses
are deserialized via `DeserializeLadderWitness()`. Verification entry point: `VerifyRungTx()`.

### TX_MLSC
Transaction-level Merkelized Ladder Script Conditions. The current output format replacing
per-output MLSC. One shared Merkle tree per transaction (PLC model: one program, multiple
output coils). Each output is 8 bytes (value only); the transaction carries a single shared
`conditions_root` with prefix byte `0xDF`. A creation proof witness section is validated at
block acceptance. Leaf computation uses `TaggedHash("LadderLeaf", structural_template ||
value_commitment)`. Each rung's coil has an `output_index` field declaring which output it
governs. Anti-spam surface: 112 bytes per transaction (flat). Simple payment: 647 WU /
162 vB. Batch 100: 7,867 WU / ~1,967 vB. Key functions: `IsMLSCScript()`, `GetMLSCRoot()`,
`CreateMLSCScript()`, `VerifyMLSCProof()`. Leaf order: `[rung_leaf[0], ..., rung_leaf[N-1],
relay_leaf[0], ..., relay_leaf[M-1], coil_leaf]`.

### SCHEME
Data type 0x09. Signature scheme selector, exactly 1 byte. Values defined by RungScheme.

### SCRIPT_BODY
Data type 0x0A. Serialized inner conditions, 1 to 80 bytes. Witness-only. Used by

the MAX_PREIMAGE_FIELDS_PER_WITNESS limit with PREIMAGE (combined cap of 2).

### SEQUENCER
Block type 0x0651 (PLC family). Step sequencer. Conditions: NUMERIC(current_step),
NUMERIC(total_steps). Invertible.

### SerializationContext
Enum in `serialize.h`. Two values: WITNESS (spending side, SIGNATURE and PREIMAGE allowed)
and CONDITIONS (locking side, only condition data types). Controls which implicit field
table is used and which data types are accepted.

### SIG
Block type 0x0001 (Signature family). Single signature verification. Key-consuming with
1 pubkey. Conditions: SCHEME(1). Not invertible. Witness: PUBKEY, SIGNATURE.

### Sighash
The signature hash for Ladder Script transactions, computed by `SignatureHashLadder()` in
`sighash.cpp`. Uses tagged hash `TaggedHash("LadderSighash")`. Commits to: epoch (0),
hash_type, tx version/locktime, prevouts/amounts/sequences (unless ANYONECANPAY/APO),
outputs (unless NONE), spend_type (always 0), input-specific data, conditions hash (unless
ANYPREVOUTANYSCRIPT), and output for SIGHASH_SINGLE.

### SIGNATURE
Data type 0x06. Signature, 1 to 50000 bytes (accommodates PQ signatures up to 49216 bytes
for SPHINCS+). Witness-only.

### SPEND_INDEX
Data type 0x07. Spend index reference, exactly 4 bytes.

### TAGGED_HASH
Block type 0x0203 (Hash family). BIP-340 tagged hash verification. Conditions:

pubkey count. Conditions: NUMERIC(threshold_M), NUMERIC(csv). Not invertible.

### TIMELOCKED_SIG
Block type 0x0701 (Compound family). SIG + CSV combined. Key-consuming with 1 pubkey.
Conditions: SCHEME(1), NUMERIC(csv_value). Not invertible. Witness: PUBKEY, SIGNATURE,
NUMERIC.

### TIMER_CONTINUOUS
Block type 0x0611 (PLC family). Continuous timer counting consecutive blocks. Conditions:
NUMERIC(accumulated), NUMERIC(target). Invertible.

### TIMER_OFF_DELAY
Block type 0x0612 (PLC family). Off-delay timer (hold after trigger). Conditions:
NUMERIC(remaining). Invertible.

### TxAggregateContext
Reserved. AGGREGATE attestation is not implemented in the current release. The attestation
byte is reserved for future extension via soft fork.

### value_commitment
A component of the TX_MLSC leaf hash. In the new leaf computation, each leaf is
`TaggedHash("LadderLeaf", structural_template || value_commitment)`, replacing the
previous `TaggedHash("LadderLeaf", serialized_blocks || pubkeys)`. The value commitment
binds the output value to the Merkle tree.

### VAULT_LOCK
Block type 0x0302 (Covenant family). Vault timelock covenant with hot/cold key pairs.
Key-consuming with 2 pubkeys. Conditions: NUMERIC(hot_delay). Invertible.

### WEIGHT_LIMIT
Block type 0x0802 (Governance family). Maximum transaction weight constraint. Conditions:
NUMERIC(max_weight). Invertible.

### Wire Format
The binary serialization of `LadderWitness`, defined in `serialize.h/cpp`. Structure:
`[n_rungs]` then per-rung `[n_blocks]` with blocks encoded as micro-header or escape +
type, followed by implicit or explicit fields. After rungs: coil (type + attestation +
scheme + address + conditions + rung_destinations), then relays and per-rung relay_refs.
Key constants: `MAX_RUNGS = 16`, `MAX_BLOCKS_PER_RUNG = 8`, `MAX_FIELDS_PER_BLOCK = 16`,
`MAX_LADDER_WITNESS_SIZE = 100000`, `MAX_PREIMAGE_FIELDS_PER_WITNESS = 2` (per-input),
`MAX_PREIMAGE_FIELDS_PER_TX = 2` (per-transaction), `MAX_RELAYS = 8`, `MAX_RELAY_DEPTH = 4`.

### Witness Reference
Struct `WitnessReference` in `types.h`. When `n_rungs == 0` on the wire, rungs and relays
are inherited from another input's witness. Only field-level diffs (via `WitnessDiff`) and
a fresh coil are provided. Coil is never inherited. Resolution happens in `VerifyRungTx()`.
